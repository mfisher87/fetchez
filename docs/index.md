Fetchez is a lightweight, open-source command-line tool and Python library designed to discover and download geospatial data from a wide variety of public repositories. 

It unifies over **40 different data sources** (and counting), such as NASA, USGS, NOAA, and ESA, into a single, standard interface.

## 🌎  Why Fetchez?

Fetching elevation, bathymetry, or oceanographic data usually involves navigating dozens of different APIs, FTP sites, and web portals. Fetchez solves this by providing:

* One command to fetch them all. No more memorizing `curl` flags or API endpoints.
* Our local spatial index (FRED) lets you query file-based repositories (like NCEI or Copernicus) instantly without hammering remote servers.
* Built-in connection pooling and byte-range support ensure large downloads survive flaky internet connections.

## 📦  Installation

Fetchez is a standard Python package. You can install it directly from the source:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/ciresdem/fetchez.git](https://github.com/ciresdem/fetchez.git)
cd fetchez
pip install .
```

## 💻  Usage

The core philosophy is simple: Define a Region, Pick a Module.
### The Basics

Fetch SRTM+ topography for a specific bounding box (west, east, south, north):

``` bash
fetchez -R -105.5/-104.5/39.5/40.5 srtm_plus
```

### Search by Place Name

Don't know the coordinates? Use a place name:

```bash
fetchez -R loc:"Boulder, CO" copernicus --datatype=1
```

### Discover Data

Not sure what dataset you need? Browse the registry:
```bash
# List all available modules
fetchez --modules

# View detailed metadata for a specific module
fetchez --info gmrt

# Search for modules based on tags or names
fetchez --search usgs
```

## 🗺️ Supported Data

We support a growing federation of data sources:

| Category | Example Modules |
|----|----|
| Topography | srtm_plus, copernicus, nasadem, tnm (USGS), arcticdem |
| Bathymetry | gmrt, emodnet, gebco, multibeam, nos_hydro |
| Oceanography |tides, buoys, mur_sst |
| Reference | osm (OpenStreetMap), vdatum |
| Generic | http (Direct URL), earthdata (NASA) |

## 🐄  Plugins & Extensions

Need to fetch data from a specialized local server, a private S3 bucket, or a niche API? You don't need to fork the repo!

Fetchez supports **user-defined plugins**. Simply drop a Python script into your configuration folder, and it will be automatically registered as a command.

**Quick Start:**

1.  **Create the folder:** `mkdir -p ~/.fetchez/plugins`
2.  **Add your script:** Drop a Fetchez supported Python file (my_data.py) inheriting from `FetchModule` into that folder.
3.  **Run it:** `fetchez -m my_data`

Your plugin instantly gains all of Fetchez's powers: smart region parsing, multi-threaded downloading, and retry logic.

See the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/ciresdem/fetchez/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for a full code example.

## 🤝  Contribute new Fetchez Modules!

The power of Fetchez lies in its registry. The more modules we have, the more powerful the tool becomes for the entire geospatial community.

**Do you have a favorite public dataset?** Don't keep the script to yourself; turn it into a Fetchez module!

### How to Contribute

Adding a module is easy:

1. Create a Class: Inherit from fetchez.core.FetchModule.

2. Implement run(): Define how to translate user input into URLs suitable to download.

3. Register It: Add your modules metadata (Agency, Resolution, License) to registry.py.

We have a comprehensive guide to help you get started:

## 🔱  Disclaimer on Data Persistence

We provide the tools to locate and download data from authoritative public repositories, but we do not host the data ourselves.

Government agencies reorganize websites, migrate APIs (e.g., WCS 1.0 to 2.0), or decommission servers without notice. A module that fetches perfectly today may encounter a 404 tomorrow.

Source datasets are frequently updated, reprocessed, or removed by their custodians. The "best available" data for a region can change overnight.

Remote servers (like NOAA NCEI, USGS, or Copernicus) may experience downtime, throttling, or rate limits that are entirely outside our control.

We strive to keep our modules robust and our index fresh. If you encounter a broken fetch or a changed endpoint, please open an issue. This helps the whole community keep up with the changes!
